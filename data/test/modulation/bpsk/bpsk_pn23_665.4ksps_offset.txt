Feed into Airspy via 20dB attenuator, recorded using SDRSharp.

There is an offset of about 3294 Hz from the DC center. It was measured by
squaring the signal, plotting its FFT using 64k points, and measuring the
frequency of the highest peak.

The center frequency in the SDRSharp was set to 1 GHz, however based on the
naming of the initial file it was actually 999,998,418 Hz. The signal generator
is not officially calibrated, and there might be other sources of mismatch,
which explains the offset in this recording.
